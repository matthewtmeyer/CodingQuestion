# CodingQuestion
Iteration_v1

Implemented in javascript due to ease of executing in browser and validating the logic.

Given the open-endedness of the question I would be happy to further explain my approach.

See getTriangleName() in CodingAnswer.html for logic that answers the row/column for a specific coordinates.

Assumptions:
-UI allows user to choose top/bottom triangle and the location (x,y) of the right angle.
-If required to support 3 points, the 3 points would be converted to a type and location of the right angle.
-Top left coordinate is 0,0 (increases by 10 pixels right and down).
